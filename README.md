# What's the culprit behind your blackout?

## Introduction 

In this project, we studied the effectiveness of spice challenges in building team morale.

## Cleaning and EDA

There were some columns in the excel that contained notes about the sheet and noted the units of each variable. These were made for improved readibility but could not be used in actual data collection and analysis, so I excluded these from my dataframe before applying analysis. Additionally, I combined OUTAGE.START.DATE and OUTAGE.START.TIME into one timestamp in the column OUTAGE.START. The same was done to create the OUTAGE.RESTORATION column based on outage restoration date and time.

### Univariate Analysis

The following is a univariate bar chart listing the different categories of power outage causes and the percent of outages they contribute to. The prime contributer to power outages appears to be severe weather.

### Bivariate Analysis

To explore the bivariate relationship between power outage causes and average power outage duration, we can look at this following bar chart. The chart suggests that on average, the longest power outages appear to be caused by fuel supply emergencies.

Continuing with bivariate exploration, the following line plot includes the three overall most common power outage causes (severe weather, intentional attack, and system operability disruption), and it shows the proportion of power outages they cause each year from 2000-2016. The graph suggests there may have been a decrease in the proportion of outages caused by severe weather and an increase in the proportion of outages caused by intentional attacks.

### Interesting Aggregate

This table shows an aggregation of power outages based on the CLIMATE.CATEGORY column corresponding to whether an outage occurs during a cold, normal, or warm climate episode (based on the Oceanic Ni√±o Index). The Mean column represents the average number of outages that occur within each Climate Category. This aggregation is potentially useful in exploring whether a certain climate type has some affect over the number of power outages that occur.


| Climate Category   |    Mean |
|:-------------------|--------:|
| cold               | 753.262 |
| normal             | 759.289 |
| warm               | 804.055 |

## Assessment of Missingness

I do not believe any of the missing data is not missing at random (NMAR). This is because most of the missing data can be inferred from other columns in the data. For example, entries in the HURICANE.NAMES column are missing whenever a power outage is not caused by a hurricane, so entries in this column are probably missing by design. Other missing entries are more likely to be MAR rather than NMAR. This can be seen with missing OUTAGE.START.TIME entries. If an outage occurred because of equipment failure or severe weather, it might've been difficult to record the exact time of outage, so the missingness of OUTAGE.START.TIME could depend on CAUSE.CATEGORY.
